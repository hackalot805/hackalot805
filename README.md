### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shaun Harrington and I develop software. I'm currently working at Dozuki, an iFixit spin-off located in beautiful San Luis Obispo. At Dozuki we build software that helps companies implement a continuous improvement culture to improve their people, their processes, and their communication.
